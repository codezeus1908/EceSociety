I had an interest in electronics from the very 1st year, but as an average student, I faced a lot of difficulties. I did my best and with all my hard work I started feeling confident and finally fell in love with Electronics. After 2nd year, I got a chance to be the part of ECESOC, it helped me a lot in building my personality and the guidance from seniors helped me to evolve into my career. It has been a journey worth all my efforts. Currently, I am an Analog and mixed-signal design Engineer at Synopsys. I’m in love with my profession because I always wanted to be here. My only suggestion for the juniors would be to dream big, it is the only thing that gives life its purpose and direction.

The workshop pumped up with the discussion on semiconductors then, their types(N-Type and P-Type),P-N Junction, rectifiers, clippers-clampers, BJT,FET, MOSFET, etc. The volunteers being seniors, gave some tips to tackle the problems regarding the subject , books and sites for reference to the fresh batch. Some practical electronic projects were displayed and their workings were shown to show the applications of the topics taught. The top three students who came out with flying colors were awarded with certificates.\",\n  fblink: \"https://www.facebook.com/ecesoc.bitmesra/posts/2433614343546932\",\n  instalink: \"\"\n},\n{\n  name: \"Gateway To Digital\",\n  Participants: \"50\",\n  src: \"gateway_to_digital\",\n  Description: \"A Two-day workshop was organized on 29th and 30th of September, 2018 by the Electronics and Communication Engineering Society (ECESOC), Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. The objective of the workshop was to explain how Digital Electronics can be utilised in microprocessor design. The session was interactive, students came up with doubts and satisfactorily cleared all of them at the moment. The passionate attendees enthralled the volunteers to give as much knowledge and information as possible. The workshop involved Comparison of analog and digital electronics, logic functions and truth table, logic gates, basic theorem properties, Boolean Functions, minterm-maxterm, k-map, adder, subtractor, decoder, encoder, mux, demux, flip-flops, etc. The volunteers being seniors, gave some tips to tackle the problems regarding the subject , books and sites for reference. Some practical electronic projects were displayed and their workings were shown to show the applications of the topics taught and hands on hardware projects were provided.Students were awestruck to encounter the working models and the Arduino project outshone all the other projects. The workshop was concluded with certificate of participation given to the attendees to boost their confidence.\",\n  fblink: \"https://www.facebook.com/ecesoc.bitmesra/posts/2433614343546932\",\n  instalink: \"\"\n}];\n\nconst ongoingEvents = [\n  \n    //name: \"How to pursue Career in Electronics\",\n    //src: \"How to pursue Career in Electronics\",\n    //rlink: \"https://forms.gle/vgFwrX5uAakmsAis5\",\n    //details: [\"Everyone gets tensed regarding their future career options at some point.
